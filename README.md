# PP3-Spotify Music Search App

## Project Overview

PP3-Spotify Music Search App is a web application that allows users to search for music through Spotify's API. The application is built with a React frontend and an Express backend, integrating Spotify's REST Web API for a seamless music search experience. It features user authentication through Spotify's OAuth 2.0 flow, secured with JWT.

### **Project Vision**

- **Spotify Authentication with JWT**: Users can log in using their Spotify credentials, with secure authentication handled via Spotify's OAuth 2.0, Passport.js, and JWT.
- **Music Search Functionality**: Users can search for artists, albums, and tracks using the Spotify API, with results dynamically displayed on the frontend.
- **Interactive UI**: The application features an intuitive and visually appealing user interface, allowing users to interact with their search results.
- **Secure Credential Management**: Sensitive credentials are securely stored in environment variables and not exposed in the repository.

## Current Progress

### **Completed Features**

- **Spotify Authentication**: Users can log in via Spotify, with JWT securely generated and stored in MongoDB.
- **Token Management**: JWT is implemented for secure token handling, with validation logic for expired tokens.
- **Spotify API Search**: Backend route `/api/search` allows users to query the Spotify catalog for albums, artists, and tracks, returning relevant search results.

### **Next Steps**

- **Frontend Implementation**: Develop the frontend components to display search results, manage user sessions, and handle user authentication.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the UI is responsive and works well on various devices, including mobile.
- **Additional Features**: Create a user dashboard to display favorite artists, recently played tracks, and personalized Spotify data.

## Getting Started

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   `git clone https://github.com/FarmerSamuel-FS/SpotifyMusicApp.git`
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   `cd SpotifyMusicApp`

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   `npm install`

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
